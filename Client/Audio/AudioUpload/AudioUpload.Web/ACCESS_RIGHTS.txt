Need to give "IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool" user (or whatever AppPool you're running the Web Application under at IIS) to Uploads and to temp\Uploads folders

If you can't find AppPool related users in your system using the pattern "IIS APPPOOL\<AppPoolName>", see http://serverfault.com/questions/81165/how-to-assign-permissions-to-applicationpoolidentity-account for more info
